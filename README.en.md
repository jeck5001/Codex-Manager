## Recent Changes
- Current latest version: `v0.1.6` (2026-03-07)
- The `main` branch has continued moving after `v0.1.6`; see the `Unreleased` section in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full post-`v0.1.6` history.
- Protocol compatibility keeps tightening around Codex / OpenAI behavior: `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, and Claude `/v1/messages` are now more closely aligned, including multi-MCP tool preservation, long tool-name shortening, and response restoration for Cherry Studio, OpenClaw, Claude Code, and similar clients.
- Gateway runtime and diagnostics are stronger: failure responses expose structured `errorCode` / `errorDetail` fields and trace headers, long-running SSE turns are more resilient to idle disconnects, and the Settings page now exposes upstream stream timeout and SSE keepalive controls with runtime hot reload.
- Desktop behavior was tightened as well: startup now restores dashboard / account / request-log snapshots earlier, successful login refreshes the accounts table automatically, and platform-key creation plus upstream-proxy save flows were cleaned up.
- The Web auth flow is safer: `codexmanager-web` still persists the password, but authenticated sessions are now scoped to the current Web process, so old cookies do not survive a full close-and-reopen cycle.
- The release pipeline stays consolidated under `release-all.yml` for one-click Windows / macOS / Linux publishing, with local frontend build fallback when prebuilt artifacts are unavailable.

## Features
- Account pool management: groups, tags, sorting, notes
- Bulk import / export: multi-file import, recursive desktop folder import for JSON, one-file-per-account export
- Usage dashboard: 5-hour + 7-day windows, plus accounts that only expose a 7-day window
- OAuth login: browser flow + manual callback parsing
- Platform keys: create, disable, delete, model binding
- Local service with configurable port
- Local OpenAI-compatible gateway for CLI and third-party tools

## Quick Start
1. Launch the desktop app and click `Start Service`.
2. Go to Accounts, add an account, and complete authorization.
3. If callback parsing fails, paste the callback URL manually.
4. Refresh usage and confirm the account status.

## Page Overview
### Desktop
- Accounts: bulk import/export, refresh accounts and usage
- Platform Keys: bind keys by model and inspect request logs
- Settings: manage ports, proxy, theme, auto-update, and background behavior

### Service Edition
- `codexmanager-service`: local OpenAI-compatible gateway
- `codexmanager-web`: browser-based management UI
- `codexmanager-start`: one command to launch service + web
